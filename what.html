    <p>
      I don't imagine us as a fairytales story that resolves itself, but I imagine us as something built slowly with awareness of what can and cannot be rushed.
    </p>
    <p>
    What we're building isn't dependent on constant reassurance or dramatic moments, but I think it's built through planning, honesty, and the willing to name difficulties instead of avoiding them..
    </p>
    So.. we are factoring in time, health, distance, and also growth in here. Not pretending they don't exist, but asking how we move with them rather than against them.
    </p>
    This isn't about control or certainty, but it's about alignment. About choosing to face reality together instead of constructing illusions separately.
    </p>
    If this continues, I hope this will be sustain. I don't expect it to be perfect either, and I don't expect this to be easy. At least just real enough to last.
