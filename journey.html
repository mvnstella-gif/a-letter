      I don't think our story begain with that app. That was just a surface event there. What stayed with me was how direct you were.
      The fact that you didn't circle, you didn't perform, and you asked for a call simply and clearly as if honesty was the most natural option there.
    </p>
     <p>
      I didn't expect that much that night. I thought it would be polite conversations and it will passing.
      Instead, we talked about free will. We didn't ease into each other through small talk. We entered through ideas, through how we see choices, responsibility, etc. 
      That says a lot about you and maybe about me too.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, things didn't rush, but they also didn't drift because we talked about real constraints. 
      Your surgery, your plans for the next two years, and my life here. The distance doesn't negotiate with intention.
    </p>
    Slowly, this stopped being hypothetical. You became someone my family knows about. Someone my friends recognize, not just by name, but by presence.
    And I became part of your everyday thinking, even from miles away.
    So, this journey hasn't been about intensity. It's been about consistency. About choosing to stay in the same conversation, even when it would be easier to avoid complexity.
    </p>
    I don't know exactly where this path leads, but I know it hasn't been accidental. And that matters more to me than certainty. :]
