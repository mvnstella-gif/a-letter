    <p>
      If I try to be precise, the probability of us meeting, connecting, and sustaining this kind of conversation was never high.
      Different countries, continent, timelines, starting points
    </p>
    But probability doesn't explain anything. Some outcomes exist not because they were likely, but because they were chosen, repeatedly.
    <p>
     I don't see you as simple guy, even when you call yourself that. The fact that you're observe, you're analyze, you break things down until they make sense to you, even if it takes forever.
    </p>
    You move through life like someone optimizing under constraints. You don't deny the limits of your body or your circumtances, but you also don't let them define your ambition. 
    You adjust, recalibrate, and continue.
    </p>
    What stands out to me is not how much you think, but how responsible you are with your thinking. You don't want beliefs that feel good if they don't fold. You also don't want comfort at the cost of accuracy.
    </p>
    This is how I see you right now. Well, at least for now. We will see if these would change. :]
