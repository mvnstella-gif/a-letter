       Hey, love.
      </p>
      If you're reading this, I want to let you know that you're good at endurance. You know how to absorb pressure without making it visible. You don't dramatize difficulty, and you rarely ask for relief. Strength, for you, often means containment.
      </p>
      But here's something important: constantly "being strong" is not neutral, it costs something. It cost softness, it cost rest, sometimes it costs connection.
      </p>
      Strenghts doesn't always mean pushing through. Sometimes it means allowing a moment where you don't have to perform stability, or where you don't have to be ahead of your emotions, or in control of every reaction.
      </p>
      In other words.... you're allowed to feel uncertain without immediately correcting it. You're allowed to feel tired without turning it into a problem to solve. Holding yourself together is admirable, but it doesn't have to be permanent.
      </p>
      So, if right now you're strong because you have to be, that's okay. Just remember: strenghts is not dimnished by letting someone see the effort behind it. 
      </p>
      You don't have to collapse, explain, or prove anything. Just know this: you're allowed to put the armor down occasionally. Nothing important about you disappears when you do. I'm here, love.
      </p>
      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
      </p>
