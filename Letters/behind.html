       Hey, love.
      </p>
      If you're reading this at this point where we've truly made it this "far", close enough to calling each other "official-official" partner, then this part exists for one reason only.
      </p>
      If this open now, it means something rare happened. Not with luck, not momentum, choice.
      </p>
      We didn't arrive here because everything was easy. We arrived because when things became complicated, we stayed honest instead of dissappearing. We learned how to slow down without giving it up. How to listen without needing to win, and how to choose each other without losing ourselves.
      </p>
      We weren't to rush meaning, not romanticize the future, but to name a hope that I've carried quietly.
      </p>
      I hope what we build is healthy, not impressive. A marriage where strength doesn't have to be performed. Where honesty feels safer than silence, and effort matters more than being right.
      </p>
      I hope we learn how to repair instead of withdraw, how to sit with discomfort without turning it into distance, how to disagree without turning each other into problems that need fixing.
      </p>
      I never expect perfection. I hope we stay aware. I hope we keep choosing clarity, even when avoidance feels easier. I hope we don't confuse endurance with love, or stability with stagnation.
    </p>
    So.. if one day we call this a "thing", I mean, more than just you're asking me to be your girlfriend xD I hope it feels like a place we can rest in. Not a role to maintain, not a system to survive, but a partnership that stays human, even when life isn't gentle.
          </p>
      This isn't a promise wrapped in certainty. It's intention, spoken softly. Only meant to be read if we truly arrive here together.
      </p>
      Love you, iubireu.

      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
      </p>
