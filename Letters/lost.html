    <h1>Open This When You Feel Lost</h1>

      There will be days when everything feels heavier than it should, when nothing makes sense no matter how hard you try to hold it together. If today is one of those days, open this. I wrote it for the version of you who trying to navigate things quietly, without asking for help, even when you need it the most.

      <p>
       Hey, love..
      </p>
      If you're reading this because you feel lost, I want you to know something first: this doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. You're just in a moment where the world is shifting faster than you can adjust, and that doesn't say anything about your worth or your strength. Being lost does not mean you made the wrong choices, it means your internal map hasn't caught up with your current position yet.
      </p>
      </p>
      You know, love, you're not directionless. You're between coordinates. Orientation comes later. Nothing needs to be solved by now. No decisions need to be made under pressure. You can pause for a bit here. Check what is still true, you know. Your values have not disappeared, your capacity to think clearly still exists, and this moment does not define the whole trajectory. Feeling lost is often as a sign of transition, not failure :] and i think growth rarely announces itself with certainty.
      </p>
      </p>
      If everything feels noisy, maybe you can reduce the task: do the next small, necessary thing. Not to fix everything, just to stay oriented.
      Orientation returns through movements, not through overanalysis.
      So, you're allowed to take time without losing direction. You are not behind, love. You're recalibrating :]
    </p>

      <p>Love you,<br>SM</p>
      </p>
