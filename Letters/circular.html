       Hey, cinta.
      </p>
      If you're reading this because your thinking becomes circular, just a gently reminder here.. Circular thinking is not a lack of intelligence. It is often a sign that your mind is trying to solve something that cannot be solved at its current level.
      </p>
      When this happens, it helps to stop asking new questions and return to first principles. What is actually known? What assumptions are you carrying without realizing it? What decision are you trying to force clarity on before its time? You don't need to think harder sometimes. You need to think less in a more grounded way.
      </p>
      Step away if its needed. Orientation doesn't return through intensity sometimes. But it returns through reduction :] So.. it's okay, love. Not every problem opens under pressure. 
      </p>
      Some resolve when you loosen your grip.

      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
