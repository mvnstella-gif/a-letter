    <h1>Open This If Our Paths Change</h1>
    <div class="meta">
    Please only open this if our paths truly change. Not during distance, not during confusion, not during a difficult season or temproary pause. This isn't meant for moments of doubt, exhaustion, or fear. It's meant for a reality where we are no longer walking toward the same future, and both of us know it clearly and quietly.
    </p>
     If that hasn't happened, close this. Some words are only meant for endings that are real.

       Frank,
      </p>
      If you're opening this, it means something has shifted. Not necessarily because something went wrong, but because life sometimes redirects without asking for permission first.
      </p>
      I'm writing this not as an anticipation, but as an acknowledgement: that meaningful connections don't lose their value just because their form changes. What we shared was not an accident. It wasn't built out of  loneliness, convenience, or lack of options. It was built through deliberate attention, effort, and mutual choosing.
      </p>
      If at some point we stop walking in the same direction, I don't want you to interpret that as failure. Sometimes, two people can be sincere, thoughtful, and real, yet still arrive at different coordinates.
      </p>
      If distance changes its meaning, or silence lasts longer than expected, I hope you remember this: nothing about what we built was wasted. You were not wrong for trusting, I was not wrong for choosing you, And this connection was not a mistake simply because it didn't continue in the same form.
    </p>
    If this chapters ends, I want it to end without bitterness, without erasing what was true. What mattered mattered because it existed, not because it lasted forever.
    </p>
    So, if you're reading this alone, I hope you read it with steadiness, not loss. With gratitude, not doubt. Wherever you stand after this, I hope you continue choosing clarity over fear, and intention over avoidance. 
    </p>
    Thank you for walking part of the way with me. That choice, at least, was real.
    </p>
    <br>SM</p>
      </p>
