    <h1>Open This One Day Before We Meet</h1>
    <div class="meta">
      There is a strange kind of excitement that comes before meeting you. It sits somewhere between nerves and warmth, like my body knows something important is about to happen. Jakarta and Bucharest have always felt impossibly far, yet somehow the thought of seeing you makes the distance feel smaller for a moment. This page is for every time we are one day away from closing that space again, whether it is the first meeting or the fifth.

      <p>
       Hey, love.
      </p>
      If you're reading this, you're in the familiar mix of calm and restless, the way you get whenever something that is matter for you. I know you will try to pretend you're fine and collected, but I also know you will keep checking the time and planning everything in your head :P 
      </p>
      It still amazes me how all of this started. We matched on an app without thinking too much, and then somehow you were the one who asked me to get on a call. I didn't expect anything, but there we were, talking like we had known each other for longer than a few hours. You were direct, asking where this could lead, asking about free will like it was the most natural thing to discuss with a stranger you had just met.
      </p>
      That first call set the tone for everything. You fell asleep on the line, and then you stayed with me on the call until I fell asleep too. It became a rhythm after that. Night after night, without really planning it, we just kept showing up for each other. We didn't skip. We didn't fade. It felt steady in a way that surprised me.
      </p>
      And now here we are, one day before everything becomes real. No more screens, no more guessing the shape of your presence, no more imagining how you sound when you're close.
      </p>
      If your heart feels a little fast right now, mine does too. Tomorrow is the moment all those calls, all those nights, all those conversations have been quietly building toward.
Breathe, rest, and let yourself feel everything.
    </p>
    So if you are reading this one day before we meet, breathe. Rest. Let the excitement sit with you. Tomorrow is ours, and we will finally see what distance has been preparing us for all this time. See you tomorrow, my love.

      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
      </p>
