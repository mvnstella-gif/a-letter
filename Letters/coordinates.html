      <strong>PROLOGUE</strong>
      <p>
        Frank, this whole thing started because I wanted to keep a small record of you. Not to define you, but to remember you. How you speak, how you pause before answering, how you stay steady even when you're tired or overwhelmed. You don't try to impress people, but you just show up. Somehow, that matters more than effort ever could.
      </p>
      I notice how carefully you move through life, even when things feel messy. Maybe I only see fragments, but even those fragments tell me something real. I don't know what this page will become. For now, it's simply a place where your name feels safe. A quiet corner that belongs to you.
      </p>
      You once asked me about free will. About whether we really choose, or whether we're following patterns we don't fully see. I think about that often when I think about us/ Because none of this feels accidental. Not the distance, not the timing, not even the doubts. It's interesting to see how two Coordinates, far apart, yet somehow we're choosing to stay in the same conversations. Hope you're willing to read this carefully.
      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>

      <strong>CHAPTER 1: A Field Notes, F</strong>
      <p>
        I catch myself noticing you in small, and unremarkable moments. The way you move with consideration. the way you pause, wait, or recalibrate before acting. It feels like your body is something you listen to closely, not something you fight against.
        There are limits you live with, but you don't resent them. You account them very thoughtfully.
      </p>
      One thing I keep noticing is how little you complain, even when adjusting costs you energy. You seem to know when slowing down is wiser than pushing through, and when continuing gently matters more than stopping altogether. 
      To people around you, you probably appear composed, independent, and quietly intentional.
       </p>
       What stands out to me is not effort, but restraint. As if life for you is something to be navigated with discipline rather than narrated through complaint. There's a steadiness in how you carry yoursellf. Not because things are easy, but because you've learned how to move forward without asking the world to soften first.
       <p>

      <strong>CHAPTER 2: How You Think</strong>
      <p>
      From what I see, your thinking often comes from a need to stand on something solid. You don't seem comfortable with quick answers, you question certainty when it arrives too neatly. I get the sense that you prefer slow reasoning over beliefs that feel comforting but unstable.
        </p>
      Well, I might be wrong, but it feels like you observe your own thoughts as carefully as you observe the world. You question your biases, your motivations, even your emotional reactions, as if nothing should govern you without earning your trust first. Especially not yourself.
         </p>
         At times, it looks like you place a heavy demand on precision, particularly on your own decisions. As if a mistake in thinking could carry more weight than just being wrong. Yet what I see isn't rigidty, but it's seriousness. A sense of responsibility toward how you live and choose.
        </p>
        You don't seem to pursue truth to appear intelligent, but you pursure it because you don't want your life built on illusion. And I love that about you.
        </p>
      <strong>CHAPTER 3: The Parts You Rarely Show</strong>
      <p>
       There are parts of you that I don't see often. Not because they're absent, but because you guard them very carefully. I notice fatigue you never turn into a story. Fear you don't dramatize, vulnerability you keep contained, perhaprs knowing that not everyone knows how to hild it without causing harm.
      <p>
       You seem to carry more internally than most people realize, not just about the present, but about sustainability, the future, about how to remain yourself in a world that doesn't always make space easily.
      </p>
       Sometimes, and I could be projecting here, it feels like you want support but don't want to risk becoming a burden. Like you want rest, but worry about losing control. These parts are quiet, they don't announce themselves. But they feel real to me, and in them, I see a kind of strength that doesn't need to be visible to exist.
      </p>

      <strong>CHAPTER 4: Distance</strong>
      <p>
        Distance, in our case, is not just geography. It's time zones, delayed replies, separate mornings, and nights that don't overlap. You live there, I live here. Our lives unfold in parallel, often aware of each other, but rarely synchronized.
      </p>
      What surprises me isn't how difficult this distance can be, but how deliberate we've become within it. Affection is chosen, conversations are intentional. And silence, when it appears, feels more like timing than absence.
      </p>
      There are moments when I wish proximity could carry what words sometimes fail to hold. And there are moments when distance forces a clarity that closeness might have blurred We cannot rely on habit, we have to rely on presence even when it is mediated by screens.
      Distance does not weaken what we build, 
      It reveals what survives without convenience :]
      <p>
      <strong>CLOSURE</strong>
      <p>
        This is not a promise written in certainty.
        It is a commitment written in attention.
      </p>
      I'm not walking toward an idealized version of you, or of us.
      I'm walking with what is real, imperfect, and unfolding.
      I'm still learning where I can be steady, and where I still need to grow.
      If this path continues, I want to be with honesty rather than illusion
      with patience rather than pressure. 
      Not because it is easy, but because it feels deliberate.
      </p>
      So.. this is not an ending. 
      It is a pause, acknowleged.
      And if we keep moving forward,
      Hope it will be with clarity, and with care also. :]
    </p>
