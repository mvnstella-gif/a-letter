  <strong>PROLOGUE</strong>

  <p>
    Frank, this whole thing started because I wanted to keep a small record of you.
    Not to define you, but to remember you. How you speak, how you pause before answering,
    how you stay steady even when you're tired or overwhelmed. You don't try to impress people,
    but you just show up. Somehow, that matters more than effort ever could.
  </p>

  <p>
    I notice how carefully you move through life, even when things feel messy.
    Maybe I only see fragments, but even those fragments tell me something real.
    I don't know what this page will become. For now, it's simply a place where your name feels safe.
    A quiet corner that belongs to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You once asked me about free will. About whether we really choose, or whether we're following
    patterns we don't fully see. I think about that often when I think about us.
    Because none of this feels accidental. Not the distance, not the timing, not even the doubts.
    Two coordinates, far apart, yet somehow choosing to stay in the same conversation.
  </p>

  <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>

  <strong>CHAPTER 1: Field Notes, F</strong>

  <p>
    I catch myself noticing you in small, unremarkable moments.
    The way you move with consideration. The way you pause, wait,
    or recalibrate before acting. It feels like your body is something
    you listen to closely, not something you fight against.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are limits you live with, but you don't resent them.
    You account for them thoughtfully.
    One thing I keep noticing is how little you complain,
    even when adjusting costs you energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    To people around you, you probably appear composed, independent,
    and quietly intentional. What stands out to me is not effort,
    but restraint. A steadiness built not from ease,
    but from learning how to move forward without asking the world to soften first.
  </p>

  <strong>CHAPTER 2: How You Think</strong>

  <p>
    Your thinking often comes from a need to stand on something solid.
    You question certainty when it arrives too neatly.
    You prefer slow reasoning over beliefs that feel comforting but unstable.
  </p>

  <p>
    You observe your own thoughts carefully.
    You question your motivations, your biases, your emotional pulls,
    as if nothing should govern you without earning your trust first.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn't rigidity. It's seriousness.
    A responsibility toward how you live and decide.
    You pursue truth not to appear intelligent,
    but so your life is not built on illusion.
  </p>

  <strong>CHAPTER 3: The Parts You Rarely Show</strong>

  <p>
    There are parts of you I rarely see.
    Not because they're absent, but because you guard them carefully.
    Fatigue you don't turn into a story.
    Fear you don't dramatize.
    Vulnerability you keep contained.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes it feels like you want support,
    but not at the cost of becoming a burden.
    These parts are quiet, but real.
    And in them, I see a strength that doesn't need to announce itself.
  </p>

  <strong>CHAPTER 4: Distance</strong>

  <p>
    Distance, in our case, is not just geography.
    It's time zones, delayed replies, separate mornings,
    and nights that don't overlap.
  </p>

  <p>
    What surprises me isn't how hard distance can be,
    but how deliberate we've become within it.
    Affection is chosen. Conversations are intentional.
    Silence becomes timing, not absence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Distance does not weaken what we build.
    It reveals what survives without convenience.
  </p>

  <strong>CLOSURE</strong>

  <p>
    This is not a promise written in certainty.
    It is a commitment written in attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm not walking toward an idealized version of you, or of us.
    I'm walking with what is real, imperfect, and unfolding.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not an ending.
    It is a pause, acknowledged.
    And if we keep moving forward,
    I hope it will be with clarity, and with care.
