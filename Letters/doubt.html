       Hi again, cinta.
      </p>
      </p>
      If you're reading this because you feel doubt, I just want to let you know: doubt doesn't mean your thinking is broken here.  It means you care about getting it right. 
      </p>
       </p>
     Before you question your conclusions, check the process. You didn't arrive here impulsively. I believe you gathered lots of information, you weighed trade-offs there and thought it very slowly.
      </p>
      </p>
      I think uncertainty is not evidence of failure, but it is the cost of your intellectual honesty. Maybe you can ask yourself one grounded question: if someone I respect made this decision using the same reasoning, would I trust it?
    </p>
    </p>
    So.. you're allowed to act without perfect certainty. Waiting for complete clarity often disguise fear as caution. If you revise your view later, that will not mean you are wrong. It will mean you learned, because let's put the blame to our gov ;] 
    </p>
    </p>
    Your judgement is not infallible here, but it's disciplined, and that matters!
    For now, hold the decision lightly. Move forward carefully, you can adjust without collapsing the whole map there.
      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
      </p>
