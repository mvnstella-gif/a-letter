     I might be wrong about this, but when you feel off, it usually looks like this from my side. Things don't fall apart, they just feel closer. Like the frame tightens and suddenly every detail demands attentnion at once.

       Hey, love..
      </p>
      I don't think your perspective disappears in moments like this, I think it shrinks. Not because you're careless, but because you care too much about getting it right. When that happens, even small things start carrying weight they weren't meant to hold.
      </p>
      So.. if everything feels heavier or sharper than usual, maybe.. don't ask yourself what's wrong. Maybe you can ask instead: what you're looking at too closely right now? What might make more sense if I stepped back, just a little?
      </p>
      You don't need to solve anything and conclusion here. You just need space for a bit.
      </p>
      If this page found you at the wrong moment, close it. If it found you at the right one, please stay.
      </p>
      Nothing you're feeling means you're losing direction, it just means you're human in the middle of too much input. I'm not here to correct your thinking, I'm here to remind you that it won't always feel this narrow.

      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
