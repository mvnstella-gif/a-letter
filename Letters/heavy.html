      If you're opening this, it probably means your head is still working, but your body isn't cooperating. Thoughts move faster than your energy.
      Plans still exist, but execution feels expensive. This isn't confusion, it's load.

       Hey, iubireu.
      </p>
      I know this state. When logic keeps working, but your chest feels tight. When you can still explain everything, yet moving feels oddly difficult. It's not confusion, it's fatigue that hasn't been given language yet.
      </p>
      You don't need to solve anything right now, you don't need insight, you don't need discipline disguised as strength.
      </p>
      </p>
      Sometimes the most honest thing your body for is permission. Permission to pause without calling it regression, permission to rest without turning it into guilt.
      </p>
      Your body is not sabotaging you, it's reporting data your mind hasn't processed yet. So.. if today all you can do is slow down, eat properly, breathe a little deeper, or exist without productivity, that is not wasted time. That is maintenance, and maintenance is not optional for anything meant to last.
      </p>
      You don't owe the world your endurance, you don't owe anyone proof that you're okay.
      </p>
      If you need to be quiet today, be quiet. If you need to feel heavy without explaining why, let it pass through without resistance.
      </p>
      This heaviness is not who you are, it's something moving through YOU. and you don't have to carry it along, even if you don't have words yet.
      <p>Love you, Weirdo.<br>SM</p>
