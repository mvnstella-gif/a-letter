    <h1>Open This When We Have Disagreement</h1>
    <div class="meta">
    If you're opening this, it probably means we're not in the best place right now. Maybe things were said too fast, maybe something landed the wrong way, or maybe we're both quiet when we don't want to be. Before reacting, take a moment there. This isn't about who's right, you know. It's about remembering why we're here in the first place :]

       Hey, love.
      </p>
      I know we don't always handle conflict perfectly. Sometimes we get defensive, sometimes we overthink, sometimes we even pull back when it feels safer to stay quiet. If this moment feels tense, I want you to remember that a fight doesn't erase everything we've built.
      </p>
      I don't believe disagreements mean failure. They're just mean two people are still trying to exist honestly in the same space. If I ever hurt you, please know it was never intentional. And if you hurt me, I want to believe it came from being human, not careless :]
      </p>
      You don't have to fix everything right now. We don't need perfect words or instant clarity. What matter is that we come back to each other with respect, curiosity, and the willingness to listen, even when it's uncomfortable :]
      </p>
      I'm not here to win arguments. I'm here to understand you, and to be understood in return. Even when things feel messy, you know, I will try to communicate it with you over distance. 
      </p>
      So.. if we're in the middle of a fight, let's pause instead of pulling away. Let's breathe, reset, and remember that we're on the same page.
    </p>
    We can talk when we're ready, not when we're reactive. Or, at least when you feel like you miss to talk with me :]
    </p>
    Love ya, weirdo. I'm here. 
      <p>Yours,<br>SM</p>
